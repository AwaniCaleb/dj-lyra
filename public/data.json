    "heading": "ABOUT LYRA",
    "description": "Born in Port Harcourt, I found peace early on in radio shows and my humble MP3 player. My passion for music grew as I embraced diverse sounds, especially the artistry of Nigerian musicians.\nMy DJ journey began unexpectedly in my first year at university when a chance encounter with a DJ set changed everything. With a mentor’s help, I honed my skills and soon found myself playing at parties and clubs.\nI blend global trends with Amapiano and Afrobeats to create unforgettable moments on any stage. For me, DJing isn’t just about music—it’s about spreading joy and connecting with my audience."
